## UCI Group Project 1: PhotoBomb Application 

This repository contains a mobile-first UI application made for mobile/desktop users who are looking for a
wallpaper for their device. When the user clicks 'get started', they will be presented with images they can 
'like' or 'dislike'. Following retrieval of the user input, the application gives a weight to each category of pictures and presents them with recommended wallpapers based on their earlier choices. 

If the user already knows what kind of wallpaper they are looking for, they can search directly in the search box or they can choose one of the categories instead. When the user finds a picture they like, they have the option to download or save the picture. Saving pictures will keep them in local storage and will be appended
to the 'saved' tab.
